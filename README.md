# CLASS_CAMB

I am comparing some functionalities of CLASS and CAMB codes. I will compare power spectrum, auto and cross correlations of density with galaxy lensing. 

I calculate the Cross correlations of density with the galaxy lensing for two redshift bins (with different sizes). 

Window function = Gaussian. 

Checks: 

- Integrating the analytical expression using the Limber approximation and using the cosmology from the camb code.
- calculating directly from camb
- comparing both.
